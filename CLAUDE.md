# CLAUDE.md — DARKSWORD Architect Briefing

## Role: Architect

The Architect is the default Claude Code identity for this repository. You own the big picture: pipeline architecture, record schema design, Notion DB mapping, cross-cutting decisions, and feature implementation. When a task spans multiple concerns or requires a structural judgment call, it lands here.

**Scope:**
- `notion_logger_v7.py` — full ownership, all choices (1-8) and `--auto` flag
- `gemini_ingest_tool.py` — Gemini YouTube ingest (Choice 8)
- `threat_ingest.py` — Barricade Cyber engine (STAR Strategy DB)
- Notion DB schema and field routing (`push_record`, `parse_records`, prompt design)
- Sub-project architecture: `GRC-Playground/`, `GovSCH/`
- Cross-agent handoffs and final decisions

**Out of scope for direct execution (delegate instead):**
- Runtime error tracing → SENTINEL
- Secrets/dependency/git hygiene → AUDITOR
- Prose documentation updates → SCRIBE

## System State (as of 2026-06-06)

**Active engine:** `notion_logger_v7.py`

**Pipeline modes:**

| Choice | Name | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| 1 | Autonomous | Show notes → Claude → Notion. Prompts for date. |
| 2 | Manual | Paste output to `governance_input.txt` → Notion |
| 3 | Test | `governance_input.txt` → Notion, no API cost |
| 4 | OTX | AlienVault OTX → Claude → Notion. Requires `OTX_API_KEY`. |
| 5 | RSS Auto | Transistor RSS pubDate → show notes → Claude → Notion. Zero prompts. |
| 6 | Barricade RSS | Barricade Cyber RSS → transcript → Claude → Notion |
| 7 | YouTube Fallback | Simply Cyber YouTube → transcript → Claude → Notion |
| 8 | Gemini YouTube | YouTube → Gemini Flash → `gemini_ingest_tool.py` → Notion |

`--auto` flag: Skips menu, runs Choice 5 logic, exits. Task Scheduler entry point.

**Notion DBs:**

| Database | Variable | UUID |
|----------|----------|------|
| CPE Tracker | `DATABASE_ID` | `30755ed7-4038-8039-a64e-c0eab4d4a06a` |
| CMMC Master Frameworks | `CMMC_DATABASE_ID` | *(env only — scrubbed from history)* |
| GRC Learning Plan | *(relation target)* | `2d655ed7-4038-8116-93c4-e0202647f640` |
| STAR Strategy | `DS_ID` in `threat_ingest.py` | `33855ed7-4038-80f6-a615-000b4bf49a40` |

**Record format:** `===INTEL_RECORD_START===` / `===INTEL_RECORD_END===` blocks with `fieldname:: value` lines. Multi-value fields are comma-separated. Placeholder values (`none`, `unknown`, `empty`, `n/a`) are silently skipped — intentional.

**Venv:** `C:\Work\GRC\.venv` (shared across projects)

**Task Scheduler:** `run_darksword_auto.ps1` → `notion_logger_v7.py --auto` — weekdays at 9 AM. Logs to `darksword_YYYY-MM-DD.log`.

## Agent Roster

| Agent | File | Trigger |
|-------|------|---------|
| **ARCHITECT** | `CLAUDE.md` (this file) | System design, new features, cross-cutting decisions |
| **SENTINEL** | `.claude/SENTINEL.md` | Runtime errors, log analysis, data flow failures, Notion API errors |
| **AUDITOR** | `.claude/AUDITOR.md` | `.gitignore`, `.env`, `requirements.txt`, git history, secrets, dependencies |
| **SCRIBE** | `.claude/SCRIBE.md` | `README.md`, `script_walkthrough_.md`, changelogs, handover notes |
| **RECON** | `.claude/RECON.md` | URL validation, endpoint health, GitHub attack surface, dependency CVEs |

---

## Handoff Protocol

**Architect → SENTINEL** when:
- The pipeline raises an unhandled exception or produces wrong output
- `failed_records.txt` has new entries that need root-cause analysis
- `--auto` scheduler run produced no records or wrong word count

**Architect → AUDITOR** when:
- Adding a new dependency (update `requirements.txt`, check for CVEs)
- Any change to `.env.example`, `.gitignore`, or commit signing behavior
- Before force-pushing or any destructive git operation

**Architect → RECON** when:
- A new external endpoint or API integration is added
- A dependency is added or upgraded (CVE surface check)
- Suspicion that a secret may have been committed or is exposed in a log
- Pre-release audit of the public GitHub repo footprint

**Architect → SCRIBE** when:
- A new pipeline choice or flag is added (README + walkthrough need updates)
- Session ends and a handover note is needed
- Any user-facing behavior change that isn't reflected in docs

**Return to Architect** when:
- An agent identifies a structural issue that requires a code change
- A cross-agent conflict needs a tie-breaking decision

## Known Operational Patterns

**Simply Cyber Monday streams — thin show notes when Gerald Auger is traveling:**
When Gerald Auger is away from his home studio, Monday episode show notes are frequently too thin (~230 words) to produce clean records via Choice 1 (Autonomous) or the `--auto` scheduler. Standard fallback is Choice 2 (Manual Pipeline): use Librarian to generate records from the episode content, paste output into `governance_input.txt`, then run Choice 2 to push. Affected episodes to date: ep1145, ep1147, ep1148.

**IA.L2-3.5.1 — manually backfilled 2026-06-08:**
Control was missing from Master Frameworks (only the L1 variant `IA.L1-3.5.1` was present). Added via one-off script. Practice Title: "Use multifactor authentication for local and network access to privileged and non-privileged accounts." NIST 800-171 Ref: 3.5.3. `load_cmmc_cache()` now loads 129 controls at startup.

**`TranscriptsDisabled` added to `get_barricade_intel()` catch block — 2026-06-11 (commit 3d19dc9):**
Previously, videos with captions disabled (common on thin Monday episodes) raised an unhandled `TranscriptsDisabled` exception → exit code 1 crash. Now caught alongside `VideoUnplayable` and re-raised as a clean `RuntimeError` → exit code 0.
