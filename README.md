# ⚔️ Project DARKSWORD — GRC Intelligence Platform

**Threat Intelligence → CMMC 2.0 Gap Analysis — Automated**

A multi-source intelligence pipeline that ingests daily security content from show notes, threat feeds, and YouTube, classifies it using Claude AI, maps it against **CMMC 2.0 / NIST 800-171** controls, links records to a live GRC learning plan, and pushes structured records into a Notion GRC repository.

Built as part of the **STAR Project** (Self-Transformation through Adversarial Rigor) — a hands-on vCISO development program. Manual mastery first, automation second.

## Why DARKSWORD

The asymmetry is real.

Nation-state actors and ransomware operators are already leveraging AI to scale attacks, accelerate reconnaissance, and craft more convincing social engineering — at a pace no human analyst can match alone.

DARKSWORD exists to close that gap.

A solo GRC analyst with a spreadsheet isn't a fair fight against an AI-augmented adversary. But a GRC analyst running an autonomous intelligence pipeline that ingests multiple threat feeds daily, maps every story to CMMC 2.0 controls, maintains a living audit trail, and surfaces critical threat intensity across 131 controls — that's a different posture entirely.

This project is proof that defenders can use the same technology to build leverage. Not to replace analyst judgment — but to amplify it.

The threat actors aren't waiting. Neither should you.

## Pipeline Modes

### DARKSWORD (`notion_logger_v7.py`)

```bash
cpe   # launches via alias
```

#### Interactive menu

| Choice | Description | Source Label |
|---|---|---|
| `1. Autonomous Pipeline` | Show Notes → Claude → Notion (prompts for date) | Simply Cyber Daily Threat Brief |
| `2. Manual Pipeline` | `governance_input.txt` → Notion | *(user-specified)* |
| `3. Test Pipeline` | Mock data → Notion (`$0.00`, `--test` flag only) | — |
| `4. OTX Pipeline` | AlienVault OTX → Claude → Notion | AlienVault OTX |
| `5. RSS Feed Pipeline` | RSS auto-detect date → Show Notes → Claude → Notion | Simply Cyber Daily Threat Brief |
| `6. Barricade Cyber` | YouTube URL → Transcript → Claude → Notion | Barricade Cyber |
| `7. Simply Cyber YouTube` | YouTube URL → Transcript → Claude → Notion | Simply Cyber Daily Threat Brief |
| `8. Gemini YouTube Ingest` | YouTube URL → Gemini transcript → Claude → Notion | *(user-selected)* |

Choice 7 is the show notes fallback — same flow as Choice 6 but tagged as Simply Cyber. Use it when the show notes page hasn't published yet or has insufficient content.

Choice 8 uses the Gemini API (`gemini-2.0-flash`) to transcribe YouTube videos that `YouTubeTranscriptApi` cannot access — restricted, age-gated, or long-form content. Prompts for a canonical source label. Requires `GEMINI_API_KEY` in `.env`. `gemini_ingest_tool.py` is the equivalent standalone script.

#### Non-interactive flags (Task Scheduler)

| Flag | Pipeline | Log file |
|---|---|---|
| `--auto` | RSS date detect → show notes → Claude → Notion (with <500-word YouTube fallback) | `darksword_YYYY-MM-DD.log` |
| `--auto-otx` | AlienVault OTX → Claude → Notion | `darksword_otx_YYYY-MM-DD.log` |
| `--auto-barricade` | Barricade RSS → transcript → Claude → Notion (with restricted-video fallback + dedup) | `darksword_barricade_YYYY-MM-DD.log` |

Flags are mutually exclusive. `--test` is also mutually exclusive with all auto flags.

#### Word count gate (`--auto`)

After `get_show_notes()` returns, the script counts words. If the result is below 500:
1. Prints a warning with the actual word count
2. Extracts the YouTube URL from the same RSS entry
3. Falls back to `get_barricade_intel()` to fetch the YouTube transcript
4. Continues the Claude/Notion pipeline with the transcript as content
5. If no YouTube URL was in the RSS entry, or the transcript fetch fails, exits cleanly (code 0)

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tmon3ygrc-sentinel/darksword.git
cd darksword
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/Scripts/activate    # Windows Git Bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env
```

Fill in `.env`:

```env
# Core
NOTION_TOKEN=secret_...
DATABASE_ID=...                  # CPE Tracker
CMMC_DATABASE_ID=...             # Master Frameworks
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
OTX_API_KEY=...                  # AlienVault OTX (for Choice 4 / --auto-otx)
GEMINI_API_KEY=...               # Gemini API (for Choice 8 / gemini_ingest_tool.py)

```

Set the `cpe` alias in `~/.bashrc`:

```bash
alias cpe='cd /c/Work/GRC/darksword && /c/Work/GRC/.venv/Scripts/python.exe notion_logger_v7.py'
```

### Security: activate the pre-commit hook

This repo ships a `gitleaks` pre-commit hook (`.githooks/pre-commit`) that scans staged changes and **blocks any commit containing a secret**. Git does not auto-run hooks from a clone (a deliberate remote-code-execution safeguard), so enable it once after cloning:

```bash
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
```

Requires the [`gitleaks`](https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks) binary on `PATH`. To confirm it's live, stage a fake secret and attempt a commit — the hook should reject it.

### Key dependencies

`notion-client` is pinned to `==2.2.1` in `requirements.txt`. The Notion SDK's async behavior changed in later versions in ways that break the synchronous pipeline. Do not upgrade without testing.

`google-genai` is required for Choice 8 and `gemini_ingest_tool.py`. Install with `pip install google-genai`. Uses `gemini-2.0-flash` via `client.models.generate_content()` with `types.Part.from_uri()` for YouTube URL passing.

## Intelligence Sources

| Source | Channel | Focus | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Simply Cyber | Show Notes | Daily tactical threat briefs | ✅ Live (auto + interactive) |
| AlienVault OTX | Threat Feed | IOC feeds, pulse intelligence | ✅ Live (auto + interactive) |
| Barricade Cyber | YouTube | DFIR, MSP/enterprise ops | ✅ Live (auto + interactive) |
| Cybernews | YouTube | Threat actor profiles, geopolitical | Planned |

---

## Task Scheduler

Three Windows Task Scheduler tasks run `notion_logger_v7.py` non-interactively on a daily schedule:

| Task | Script | Trigger |
|---|---|---|
| DARKSWORD Auto | `run_darksword_auto.ps1` | Weekdays 9 AM |
| DARKSWORD OTX | `run_darksword_otx.ps1` | Daily |
| DARKSWORD Barricade | `run_darksword_barricade.ps1` | Daily |

Each PS1 wrapper sets `PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8` and `$OutputEncoding` to prevent emoji corruption in log files, then tees stdout+stderr to a dated log file.

---

## CMMC Cache

The script queries the Master Frameworks database at launch and builds an in-memory cache of all CMMC 2.0 controls. Currently loaded: **128 controls**.

`normalize_cid()` strips whitespace and normalizes case before cache lookups. Unresolved IDs are tracked in `CMMC_MISSES` and printed in a post-run miss report so gaps can be investigated without interrupting the push loop.

---

## Learning Plan Auto-Mapping

Every intel record is automatically linked to relevant GRC learning plan weeks based on its `control_domains` and `intel_category` — no manual input required.

**Domain → Week mapping:**

| Control Domain | Learning Weeks |
|---|---|
| Incident Response (IR) | Week 23 |
| Supply Chain Risk Management (SR) | Week 19, Week 29 |
| Risk Assessment (RA) | Week 18, Week 20 |
| Access Control (AC) | Week 13 |
| Identification and Authentication (IA) | Week 13 |
| Configuration Management (CM) | Week 12 |
| System Integrity (SI) | Week 17 |
| System and Communications Protection (SC) | Week 17 |
| Security Awareness and Training (AT) | Week 5 |
| Audit and Accountability (AU) | Week 27, Week 28 |

**Category → Week mapping:**

| Intel Category | Learning Weeks |
|---|---|
| regulatory | Week 25 |
| advisory | Week 26 |
| supply-chain | Week 19, Week 29 |
| incident / ransomware / phishing | Week 23 |
| vulnerability | Week 20, Week 21 |
| malware | Week 19 |
| breach | Week 28 |
| law-enforcement | Week 25 |
| ai-risk | Week 17 |
| identity-intelligence | Week 13 |

## Known Limitations

**`get_transcript()` still blocked for Simply Cyber** — yt-dlp is blocked at the network/IP level for Simply Cyber content. This is no longer a pipeline limitation: V7's Choice 1 uses `get_show_notes()`, and the `--auto` word count gate falls back to `get_barricade_intel()` (YouTubeTranscriptApi, not yt-dlp). `get_transcript()` is retained for reference but not called by any active pipeline.

**`unknown` threat actor shows empty in Notion** — the script skips placeholder values (`none`, `unknown`, `empty`, `n/a`) to prevent noise in the database. This is intentional behavior.

**Barricade RSS may not include a YouTube URL** — if the Transistor feed entry for a Simply Cyber episode has no `yt_videoid` and no YouTube href in `entry.links`, the `--auto` YouTube fallback cannot trigger. The pipeline exits cleanly with a log message.
